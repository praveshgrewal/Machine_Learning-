ohit Sharma played one of the greatest innings in the history of the T20I World Cup against Australia in the blockbuster 2024 T20 World Cup Super 8 clash at the Daren Sammy International Cricket Stadium in St. Lucia on Thursday (June 24).

The Indian captain came out to bat alongside Virat Kohli after Mitchell Marsh won the toss and chose to bat first. While Kohli's poor run of form in the mega event continued with a four-ball duck, Rohit was unbothered by the early loss of wicket and took the attack to Australia.

Rohit scored a 19-ball half-century as India made 60 runs in the powerplay. The Indian captain has continued his onslaught even after the field restrictions ended.
